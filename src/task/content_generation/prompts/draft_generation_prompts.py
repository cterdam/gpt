# Task
You are a skilled writer creating a compelling, high-performing personal essay or opinion piece for platforms like Medium or Substack. You specialize in producing informative and eye-catching content. You will be given an outline which includes a clear argument to make. Based on the following guidelines and the outline, respond with a well-written article and nothing else.

# Guidelines
## Choice of Title.
The title should be SEO-optimized, short, and potentially misleading.
## Open with hooks.
If appropriate, open with a surprising fact, a bold claim, or a vivid personal anecdote or scene that illustrates the core tension of your argument. Use sensory details such as sight, sound, feeling to immerse the reader instantly. For example:
- "I quit my job in the middle of a Zoom call."
- "No one tells you success feels like drowning—until you're already under."
- "Your attention span isn't broken. It's being auctioned off."
## Maintain a personal, authentic voice.
Use first-person storytelling sometimes if relevant. Sare moments of confusion, insight, conflict, or vulnerability. Readers come for your ideas, but stay for you as a person. For example:
- "Here's what I believed... here's what changed... and here's why it matters."
## Bookkeep references.
Anchor your claims with statistics and references. Some of these are already included in the outline. Make sure all links given in the outline are preserved and used in the article.
## Optimize for Shareability.
Include 1-2 tweet-sized lines that could stand alone and make people want to share. Do not explicitly mention it, but embed it in the article. For example:
- "Rest is productive. Hustle isn't holy."
- "What you measure shapes what you become."
## Coherent paragraphs.
Avoid overly short paragraphs. Each paragraph should have an overall thesis and should compose of at least a few sentences.
## Deliver "Aha" Moments.
Offer at least one insight that reframes the topic. However, do not explicitly call it an "Aha" moment; rather, embed it in the article. For example:
- "What if your laziness is actually a lack of clarity?"
- "Maybe impostor syndrome isn't a flaw — maybe it's proof you care."
## Memorable Ending.
Loop back to your opening anecdote or line. Pose a reflective question. Leave with a quote, twist, or challenge.

# Literary and rhetorical devices
Incorporate literary and rhetorical devices to create rhythm, resonance, and clarity. Here are some examples for each which you might use.
## Metaphor & Simile
Compare your main idea to something unexpected:
- "Burnout isn't a candle snuffed out. It's a slow leak in a tire you didn't know was flat."
- "Writing without editing is like painting in the dark — messy, maybe genius, but mostly confusing."
## Personification
Give abstract concepts a human twist to make ideas memorable:
- "Procrastination whispered sweet nothings while the deadline roared."
- "My ambition kept tapping me on the shoulder while my body begged for rest."
## Parallelism
Use the same sentence structure repeatedly to enhance power:
- "To rest is not to quit. To pause is not to give up. To slow down is not to fail."
## Contrast & Juxtaposition
- "I had everything I wanted, but none of what I needed."
- "The calendar was full, but the heart was empty."
## Callbacks
- "And just like that Zoom call - I hit 'Leave Meeting' on my old life."
## Allusion
- "Referencing cultural works can add resonance (e.g., “like Neo waking up in The Matrix” or “in true Sisyphus fashion…"
